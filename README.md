# SNVC

Official project website for the AAAI 2022 paper "Stereo Neural Vernier Caliper". This repository is under-preparation and the initial release is expected before the conference starts.

SNVC is a multi-resolutional voxel-based stereo 3D object detection approach. It features instance-level modeling and high-resolution local scene representation learning. It enables model-agnostic refinement and tracking-by-detection.
