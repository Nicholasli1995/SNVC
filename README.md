TLDR: SNVC is a multi-resolutional voxel-based stereo 3D object detection approach. It features instance-level modeling and high-resolution local scene representation learning. It studies the local update problem in the stereo perception scenario, enabling model-agnostic refinement and tracking-by-detection.

## A simple 3D bounding box visualization tool
This is a self-contained and simple python script for drawing 3D bounding boxes in an outdoor scene. It is occlusion-aware as indicated by the dashlines.
